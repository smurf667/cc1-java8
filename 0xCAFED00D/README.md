# 0xCAFED00D sample solutions
Hello! I am the creator of the coding challenges and these are my sample solutions. They will be run outside of the coding challenge and may serve as a reference point. They will be available on December 10th, 2015, after the coding challenge evaluation has been performed.

I hope you enjoyed the challenge and that you were able to learn some more Java 8 in the process. Looking forward to the discussion about the challenges, solutions, implementation details and what we all learned while tackling the challenges.

Why this funny `artifactId`? It is [hexspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak) for "café dude", and quite some coffee was consumed preparing and implementing the challenge!
